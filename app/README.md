Android Coding Challenge: API Data Fetch and Display
===================================================

For this challenge, you will build an Android application that fetches and displays data from the JSONPlaceholder API. Your goal is to retrieve data from an endpoint of your choice (e.g., posts, users, or comments) and present it in a structured list format within the UI. The implementation details are up to youâ€”you can choose to use Jetpack Compose, XML-based views, or a combination of both. You are also free to structure the app using an Activity, Fragment, ViewModel, or any architecture you prefer.

The primary focus of this challenge is to demonstrate your ability to consume an API, efficiently map the response to Kotlin data classes, and display the data in a well-structured UI. You should handle network requests responsibly, consider UI state management, and ensure a smooth user experience. The final submission should be a fully functional app that runs in an Android environment, showcasing your proficiency in Kotlin and your familiarity with modern Android development practices.
